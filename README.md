# SAE1550 Driveshaft
## Project Overview
### Purpose of Design
These files were made for a dyno-cell driveshaft that uses a SAE1550 flange connector. The parts are all custom-made to perfectly replicate the real-life parts, this project is based on reverse-engineering already made parts to make a SOLIDWORKS assembly that would be used for interference detection. The accuracy of the SAE1550 is **+/-0.01in"**. The SOLIDWORKS drawings, and parts are made using inches as the driveshafts dimensions were assumably designed using inches (diameters are perfect multiples of 0.5in).
### Design Specifications
Key dimensions are labelled in the drawing files, please note that the drawings are not fully dimensioned- as labelling everything would clutter the drawing, only key dimensions are shown in the drawing PDF/PNG's.

Tolerances:
<li>SAE1550: 0.001"</li>
<li>Everything else: 0.1"</li>

### Compatibiltiy
The SOLIDWORK's sldprt files were made using SOLIDWORKS 2022, if you are using a version of SOLIDWORKS that is older than 2022- use the .STEP files that have been included.

### Can I use these files?
Yes, you have permission to create both public and private productions of this file, and can use them in whatever case you may need. 

### Did you make these?
Yes, I am the sole creator of the parts, assemblies, and drawing files.
